# Setup

To use react, we need to access the react javascript libraries.

Either download the javascript libraries to access offline, or include the link to online CDN for online loading.

## E.g. 
Include at the top or botton of your html page:

    <script src="../../js/react.js"></script>
    <script src="../../js/react-dom.js"></script>
